# Ikebana (Japanese Flower Arrangement): Traditional Rules & Core Principles

First: **there isn’t one single “national rulebook” for ikebana.**  
Rules vary by school (e.g., Ikenobo, Ohara, Sogetsu). However, many traditional fundamentals are widely shared.

## Core Traditional Principles (Common Across Many Schools)
- **Line over mass:** The main subject is the *line* (rise, flow, tension), not a dense bouquet.
- **Ma (negative space):** Empty space is not “missing”—it is an essential element.
- **Asymmetry:** Avoid perfect left-right balance; keep natural irregularity.
- **Seasonality:** Use materials that express the season; out-of-season choices are usually discouraged in classical styles.
- **Define a “front”:** Many arrangements are designed to be viewed from a primary angle (a chosen “face”).

## The Structural Idea: “Sansai” (Heaven–Human–Earth)
Many classical forms (especially in traditional Ikenobo-style structures) rely on three key lines:

- **Shin (Heaven):** the strongest main line; the “intention” of the piece  
- **Soe (Human):** supports and relates to Shin; creates connection  
- **Hikae / Tai (Earth):** stability, spread, grounding, and aftertaste

The concept is: **three lines can build a world.**  
Don’t “fill” weakness with extra flowers—adjust **length, angle, and spacing** first.

## Technical Rules (Where Beginners Often Slip)
- **Keep the waterline clean:** messy stems at the base make the whole work look cheap.
- **Avoid equal heights:** tips aligned on the same level instantly look artificial.
- **Don’t “line up” blossoms facing forward:** show flowers, but don’t make them behave like a neat parade.
- **Proper trimming:** remove leaves that would sit underwater; cut stems intentionally (often diagonal cuts depending on material).
- **The vessel matters:** the container isn’t just a background—its rim, opening, and empty areas are part of the design.

## The 5-Second Quality Check
1) **Can you read the main line clearly?** (If Shin is weak, everything scatters.)  
2) **Is the negative space alive?** (Do gaps feel intentional?)  
3) **Does it spread in too many directions?** (Is the “front” defined?)  
4) **Do equal lengths/angles repeat?** (That’s how “artificial” happens.)  
5) **Does it speak a season?** (Material choice reveals everything.)
